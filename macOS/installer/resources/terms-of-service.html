initial registration, by completing the sign-up process and clicking the
checkbox “I accept the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy” the
Customer submits an offer on the conclusion of the agreement to use the
Service according to the Terms of Service (the “Agreement”). If the
Customer chooses a paid subscription, the Customer will also be asked

completing the purchase process dBdone has the right to charge the fees

Customer.</p>
<p><strong>3.2.</strong> When the Customer creates a User Account, the
Customer must provide dBdone with accurate, complete, and current
information at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of these
Terms of Service, which may result in immediate termination of the
registration.</p>

ensure that the password is kept confidential at all times. The Customer
shall notify dBdone by contacting <a href="mailto:hello@dbdone.com">hello@dbdone.com</a> without undue delay

to grant the use of the User Account to any third party. The Customer is
responsible for all activity that occurs on their User Account.</p>
<p><strong>3.4.</strong> The Customer may not use a username that is the
name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for
use, a name or trademark subject to any rights of another person or
entity without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise
offensive, vulgar, or obscene.<br />

low-usage periods and announced with at least 24 hours&#39; notice when
possible.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.3.</strong> The SLA does not apply to service disruptions
caused by: (i) third-party service providers (e.g., cloud

adding additional Features, the Customer may do so without further
notice by making appropriate settings in the User Account. The
corresponding higher fee shall be billed accordingly for the remaining
period of the Agreement&#39;s term. The Customer may also decrease the type
of Features accordingly, in that case, the corresponding lower fee will
be charged with the beginning of the following billing cycle.</p>
<p><strong>6.3.1.</strong> dBdone reserves the right to change prices
for its products and services with 30 days&#39; notice to existing
customers. Price changes will be communicated via email or through the

<h2 id="16-term-and-termination">16. Term and Termination</h2>
<p><strong>16.1.</strong> The term of the Agreement shall be the chosen
subscription period (&quot;Initial Term&quot;), which will be renewed
automatically for the same period (each a &quot;Renewed Term&quot;), unless
terminated pursuant to these GTC. If the Customer is a Consumer, the
Renewed Period shall, in deviation from the foregoing, in no event be
longer than one month.</p>
<p><strong>16.2.</strong> The Customer may unsubscribe from any
subscription, and thereby terminate the Agreement according to the
period stated below, without giving reason, by using the cancellation
function in their User Account under &quot;My Products&quot; (/my_products). An
unpaid subscription may be terminated at any time with immediate effect,
whereas a paid subscription may only be terminated with effect at the
end of the ordered Initial Term or the end of the respective Renewed
Term.</p>
<p><strong>16.2.1.</strong> For monthly subscriptions, cancellation

cancellation of future charges.</p>

User Account, the Customer may do so by contacting dBdone at <a href="mailto:hello@dbdone.com">hello@dbdone.com</a> or pressing the
&quot;Delete Account&quot; button. If the Customer cancels the User Account and
still has a valid paid subscription for the Service, any amount the
Customer may already have paid for the subscription will not be
refunded.</p>
<p><strong>16.4.</strong> The right of either party to terminate the
Agreement without notice for good cause and the right to terminate the
Agreement in accordance with section 17 (extraordinary termination in
the event of changes to the GTC) shall remain unaffected. dBdone shall
be deemed to have a good cause to terminate the contract in particular
if (i) the Customer fails to comply with any applicable legal provisions
or (ii) the Customer fails to comply with any terms of these Terms of
Service, in particular section 9.2, and, where reasonable, dBdone has
given the Customer the opportunity to stop any misconduct but the
Customer failed to do so.</p>
<p><strong>16.5.</strong> With the end of the Agreement, the rights to
use the Software pursuant to clause 7 shall automatically end without
any declaration being required from dBdone. However, the Customer of
SaaS Services shall have the right to export the Customer&#39;s data in CSV
format within seven (7) days from the end of the Agreement.</p>
<h2 id="17-changes-to-the-gtc">17. Changes to the GTC</h2>
<p>dBdone reserves the right to change or amend these GTC. The planned
changes or amendments shall be announced to the Customer by e-mail or in
writing with a reasonable period of notice before the planned entry into
force. If the Customer does not object to the amended GTC in text form
(e.g. letter or e-mail) within six (6) weeks after receipt of the
e-mail, the amended GTC shall be deemed accepted, unless such changes
affect any primary obligations of dBdone to provide the Service with the
main functions as agreed between the parties. In the event of an
objection or non-acceptance of changes to primary obligations as stated
above, the original GTC shall continue to apply unchanged; in this case,
however, dBdone shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement within the
scope of an extraordinary right of termination with a notice period of
thirty (30) days from receipt of the objection to the end of the
current, as applicable, Initial Term or Renewed Term.</p>

websites or services that are not owned or controlled by dBdone.</p>

in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or
services available on or through any such websites or services.</p>

shared with dBdone in accordance with the third-party&#39;s privacy policy
and user consent.</p>
<p><strong>18.4.3.</strong> Payment processing is handled by third-party
providers (Stripe, PayPal). dBdone does not store credit card
information and is not responsible for the security of payment data
handled by third-party processors.</p>
<p><strong>18.4.4.</strong> dBdone is not liable for any issues,
outages, or data breaches that occur with third-party services, though
dBdone will work to minimize service disruption.</p>
<p><strong>18.4.5.</strong> Customers acknowledge that their use of
third-party services is subject to the respective third-party terms of
service and privacy policies.</p>

for the online settlement of disputes which can be accessed under <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>.

claims that are undisputed by dBdone or have been legally
established.</p>

through the competent courts at the consumer&#39;s place of residence or

both parties agree to attempt to resolve disputes through good faith

<p><strong>19.4.</strong> The law of the Federal Republic of Germany
shall apply exclusively. If the Customer is a Consumer and has his/her
habitual residence in another country, the Customer shall, however,
continue to have the protection afforded to consumers by provisions that
cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the law applicable in
the state of the Customer&#39;s habitual residence.</p>
<p><strong>19.5.</strong> Should a provision of these GTC be or become
invalid, contain an inadmissible deadline provision or a loophole, the
legal validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected.
Insofar as the invalidity does not result from a violation of §§ 305 ff.
BGB (validity of general terms and conditions), an effective provision
which comes closest to the economic intentions of the parties shall be
deemed to have been agreed in place of the ineffective provision. The
same shall apply in the event of a loophole. In the event of an invalid
term, the legally permissible term shall apply.</p>
