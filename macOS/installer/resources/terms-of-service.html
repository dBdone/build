    1.2. dBdone has developed the dBdone software, [an organizational tool to

    Consumers and Business Customers (each a &quot;Customer&quot;). For the
    purpose of these GTC, (i) a &quot;Consumer&quot; is any individual entering
    into the contract for a purpose not related to the individual&apos;s business,
    trade, or self-employed professional activity (&sect; 13 of the German Civil
    Code (BGB)) and (ii) a Business Customer is a user (whether an individual,
    company, or partnership vested with legal capacity) who enters into the
    relevant contract in the conduct of its business or self-employed professional
    activity (&sect; 14 of the German Civil Code (BGB)).
  </p>
  <p>
    1.5. The legal relationship between dBdone and the Customer is exclusively
    governed by these GTC. General terms and conditions of the Customer are
    excluded. Counter-confirmations of the Customer with reference to the
    Customer&rsquo;s terms and conditions are hereby contradicted.

    2.1. dBdone makes the Software available to the Customer for use for the
    duration of the Agreement via the internet or for download against payment or

    subcontractor commissioned by dBdone.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.2. dBdone only owes the properties of the functions and characteristics of

    patches, updates, and upgrades and make improvements if these (i) serve
    technical progress or (ii) appear necessary to prevent misuse. In addition,
    dBdone may modify the Software and/or the Service if (i) applicable law
    requires such modifications, (ii) the modifications are beneficial to the
    Customer, and (iii) the modifications are purely technical or procedural and
    do not materially affect the Customer. All other changes are subject to
    section 14 of these GTC.

    initial registration, by pressing [&ldquo;Create Account&rdquo;] or
    [&ldquo;Sign Up&rdquo;] and clicking the checkbox &ldquo;I accept the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy
    &rdquo; the Customer submits an offer on the conclusion of the
    agreement to use the Service according to the Terms of Service (the
    &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;). If the Customer chooses a paid subscription, the
    Customer will also be asked for payment information and the Customer will be
    informed that by clicking the button [&ldquo;Subscribe to paid plan&rdquo;]
    dBdone has the right to charge the fees via the Customer&rsquo;s chosen
    payment option respectively. Otherwise, the registration is free of charge.

    dBdone with accurate, complete, and current information at all times. Failure
    to do so constitutes a breach of these Terms of Service, which may result in
    immediate termination of the registration.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.3. The Customer shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the password
    is kept confidential at all times. The Customer shall notify dBdone by
    contacting hello@dbdone.com without undue delay if there are signs of
    unauthorized use of the Customer&rsquo;s User Account or any breach of
    security by a third party. The Customer is not authorized to grant the use of
    the User Account to any third party. The Customer is responsible for all
    activity that occurs on their User Account.

    offered payment methods and conditions will be shown on the Website.
  </p>
  <p>
    6.3. If the Customer wants to upgrade the Service by adding additional
    Features, the Customer may do so without further notice by making appropriate
    settings in the User Account. The corresponding higher fee shall be billed
    accordingly for the remaining period of the Agreement&apos;s term. The
    Customer may also decrease the type of Features accordingly, in that case, the
    corresponding lower fee will be charged with the beginning of the following

  <h5>7. Content</h5>
  <p>
    7.1. The Service allows the Customer to post, upload, save, share or otherwise
    make available text, images, or other information regardless of the form of
    that content (&quot;Content&quot;). The Customer is responsible for the
    Content that they post to the Service, including its legality, reliability,

    and license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and
    distribute such Content on and through the Service to the extent necessary to
    provide the Service (&quot;License&quot;). Apart from that, the Customer
    retains any and all rights to any Content the Customer submits, posts, or
    displays on or through the Service, and the Customer is responsible for
    protecting those rights. The Customer agrees that the License includes the
    right for dBdone to make the Content available to other users of the Service,
    who may also use the Content subject to these Terms of Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    7.3. The Customer represents and warrants that: (i) the Customer is the owner
    of the rights in and to the Content or the Customer has the right to use it
    and grant dBdone the rights under the License, and (ii) the posting of the

    with these GTC. dBdone may refuse or remove any such Content. dBdone can also
    limit or revoke the use of the Service if the Customer posts such
    objectionable Content. As dBdone cannot control all content posted by users
    and/or third parties on the Service, the Customer agrees to use the Service at
    the Customer&apos;s own risk. The Customer understands that by using the
    Service, the Customer may be exposed to content that may be offensive,
    indecent, incorrect, or objectionable, and the Customer agrees that under no
    circumstances will dBdone be liable in any way for any content, including any
    errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred
    as a result of the Customer&apos;s use of any content, except where dBdone is
    liable pursuant to section 10 hereof.
  </p>

    attorneys&rsquo; fees), and liabilities (&ldquo;Losses&rdquo;) that arise out
    of, or in connection with (i) the Customer&rsquo;s use of the Services; (ii)
    any breach by the Customer of the obligations outlined in section 8.2 hereof;
    or (iii) any claim that the Customer&rsquo;s Content caused damage to a third
    party. If the Customer is a Consumer, such obligations shall only apply if the
    Customer is responsible for the infringement resulting in any Losses.

    non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use the Software during the term
    of the Agreement in the agreed scope, particularly with the agreed storage

  </p>
  <p>10.2 The Customer may increase the scope of use pursuant to clause 6.3.</p>
  <p>
    10.3 The Customer may only reproduce the Software to the extent necessary for
    its intended use as per the current performance description. For the SaaS

    dBdone&rsquo;s server, but does not include installation or storage of the
    Software on any data media (such as hard drives) of the Customer&rsquo;s
    hardware.
  </p>

    10.4 The Customer may not decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the
    Software. The Customer has no claim to access or surrender of the
    Software&rsquo;s source code.
  </p>
  <p>

    components is subject to the corresponding terms of use for the Open Source
    Software, which are furnished and/or cited in conjunction with the Open Source

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  </p>
  <p>

    611 et seq. BGB) apply.

    (Produkthaftungsgesetz).
  </p>
  <p>

    contractual obligations are breached. Material obligations are those whose
    fulfillment is necessary for proper contract performance or whose breach
    endangers the purpose of the contract.
  </p>
  <p>
    12.3 Liability of dBdone, its representatives, and agents is excluded for
    force majeure (incl. strikes, natural disasters, pandemics) and simple
    negligent breaches of non-material contractual obligations. Strict liability
    for initial defects (&sect; 536a (1) BGB) is excluded.
  </p>
  <p>
    12.4 dBdone retains the right to object due to contributory negligence on the
    part of the Customer.
  </p>
  <p>
    12.5 dBdone shall only be liable for the loss of data up to the amount that
    would have been incurred to restore the data if it had been properly and
    regularly backed up.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>13. Limited Liability for Services Provided Free of Charge</h5>
  <p>
    Contrary to clauses 11 and 12 above, the following shall apply for Services
    provided by dBdone free of charge:
  </p>
  <p>13.1 dBdone shall not be obligated to remedy a defect.</p>
  <p>
    13.2 If the Customer has suffered harm from a defect, dBdone shall owe damages
    only if the defect was willfully concealed by dBdone. Otherwise, dBdone&apos;s
    liability shall be limited to intention and gross negligence.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>14. Data Protection and Data Security</h5>
  <p>
    14.1 Where necessary, the Customer and dBdone shall enter into an agreement
    which is subject to commissioned processing and technical organizational
    measures (TOM) in accordance with the template provided by dBdone.
  </p>
  <p>
    14.2 dBdone takes appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure
    data security. Personal data and business-critical data are stored in a secure
    environment (protected by firewall, password protection, encryption, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>15. Term and Termination</h5>
  <p>
    15.1 The term of the Agreement shall be the chosen subscription period
    (&quot;Initial Term&quot;), which will be renewed automatically for the same
    period (each a &quot;Renewed Term&quot;), unless terminated pursuant to these
    GTC. If the Customer is a Consumer, the Renewed Period shall, in deviation
    from the foregoing, in no event be longer than one month.
  </p>
  <p>
    15.2 The Customer may unsubscribe from any subscription, and thereby terminate
    the Agreement according to the period stated below, without giving reason, by
    using a respective &quot;Termination&quot; button in the User Account. An
    unpaid subscription may be terminated at any time with immediate effect,
    whereas a paid subscription may only be terminated with effect at the end of
    the ordered Initial Term or the end of the respective Renewed Term.
  </p>
  <p>
    15.3 If the Customer wants to delete the entire User Account, the Customer may
    do so by contacting dBdone at hello@dbdone.com or pressing the &quot;Delete
    Account&quot; button. If the Customer cancels the User Account and still has a
    valid paid subscription for the Service, any amount the Customer may already
    have paid for the subscription will not be refunded.
  </p>
  <p>
    15.4 The right of either party to terminate the Agreement without notice for
    good cause and the right to terminate the Agreement in accordance with section
    17 (extraordinary termination in the event of changes to the GTC) shall remain
    unaffected. dBdone shall be deemed to have a good cause to terminate the
    contract in particular if (i) the Customer fails to comply with any applicable
    legal provisions or (ii) the Customer fails to comply with any terms of these
    Terms of Service, in particular section 12.2, and, where reasonable, dBdone
    has given the Customer the opportunity to stop any misconduct but the Customer
    failed to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    15.5 With the end of the Agreement, the rights to use the Software pursuant to
    clause 7 shall automatically end without any declaration being required from
    dBdone. However, the Customer of SaaS Services shall have the right to export
    the Customer&rsquo;s data in CSV format within seven (7) days from the end of
    the Agreement.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>16. Changes to the GTC</h5>
  <p>
    dBdone reserves the right to change or amend these GTC. The planned changes or
    amendments shall be announced to the Customer by e-mail or in writing with a
    reasonable period of notice before the planned entry into force. If the
    Customer does not object to the amended GTC in text form (e.g. letter or
    e-mail) within six (6) weeks after receipt of the e-mail, the amended GTC
    shall be deemed accepted, unless such changes affect any primary obligations
    of dBdone to provide the Service with the main functions as agreed between the
    parties. In the event of an objection or non-acceptance of changes to primary
    obligations as stated above, the original GTC shall continue to apply
    unchanged; in this case, however, dBdone shall be entitled to terminate the
    Agreement within the scope of an extraordinary right of termination with a
    notice period of thirty (30) days from receipt of the objection to the end of
    the current, as applicable, Initial Term or Renewed Term.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>17. Links to other Websites</h5>
  <p>
    17.1 The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that
    are not owned or controlled by dBdone.
  </p>
  <p>
    17.2 dBdone has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the
    content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or
    services. The Customer further acknowledges and agrees that dBdone shall not
    be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss
    caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance
    on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such
    websites or services.
  </p>
  <p>
    17.3 dBdone strongly advises the Customer to read the terms and conditions and
    privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that the Customer
    visits.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>18. Final Provisions</h5>
  <p>
    18.1 The European Commission provides a platform for the online settlement of
    disputes which can be accessed under http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.
    dBdone is neither obliged to take part in alternative dispute resolutions
    before a consumer dispute settlement commission nor will do so voluntarily.
  </p>
  <p>
    18.2 The Customer shall only be permitted to offset claims that are undisputed
    by dBdone or have been legally established.
  </p>
  <p>
    18.3 The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from and in
    connection with this Agreement is Berlin if the Customer is a Business
    Customer. The place of performance is the registered office of dBdone.
  </p>
  <p>
    18.4 The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply exclusively. If
    the Customer is a Consumer and has his/her habitual residence in another
    country, the Customer shall, however, continue to have the protection afforded
    to consumers by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by
    virtue of the law applicable in the state of the Customer&rsquo;s habitual
    residence.
  </p>
  <p>
    18.5 Should a provision of these GTC be or become invalid, contain an
    inadmissible deadline provision or a loophole, the legal validity of the
    remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. Insofar as the invalidity does
    not result from a violation of &sect;&sect; 305 ff. BGB (validity of general
    terms and conditions), an effective provision which comes closest to the
    economic intentions of the parties shall be deemed to have been agreed in
    place of the ineffective provision. The same shall apply in the event of a
    loophole. In the event of an invalid term, the legally permissible term shall
    apply.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

    received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the
    supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other
    than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without
    undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we
    are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry
    out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the
    initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event,
    you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you requested to begin the performance of services during the withdrawal
    period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been
    provided until you have communicated to us your withdrawal from this contract,
    in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your right to withdraw from this Agreement expires prematurely if the Services
    were initiated by us to you only after you as a Consumer have expressly agreed
    that we shall commence with the execution of the contract before the expiry of
    the withdrawal period, and at the same time have confirmed your knowledge of
    the fact that you lose your right to withdraw from the contract with the
    beginning of the execution of the contract.
