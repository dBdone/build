lower fee will be charged with the beginning of the following billing cycle.

**15.3.1.** Customer data will be retained for the duration of the active
service period and for a reasonable period thereafter as required by law or for
legitimate business purposes.

**15.3.2.** Upon account termination, customer data will be deleted within 30
days, except where retention is required by law or for legitimate business
purposes such as fraud prevention.

**15.3.3.** Customers may request data export in standard formats (CSV, JSON)
before account termination. Data export requests will be processed within 14
business days.

**15.3.4.** Backup data containing customer information will be retained for up

## 16. Term and Termination

**16.1.** The term of the Agreement shall be the chosen subscription period
("Initial Term"), which will be renewed automatically for the same period (each
a "Renewed Term"), unless terminated pursuant to these GTC. If the Customer is a
Consumer, the Renewed Period shall, in deviation from the foregoing, in no event
be longer than one month.

**16.2.** The Customer may unsubscribe from any subscription, and thereby
terminate the Agreement according to the period stated below, without giving
reason, by using the cancellation function in their User Account under "My
Products" (/my\_products). An unpaid subscription may be terminated at any time
with immediate effect, whereas a paid subscription may only be terminated with
effect at the end of the ordered Initial Term or the end of the respective
Renewed Term.

**16.2.1.** For monthly subscriptions, cancellation takes effect at the end of
the current billing period. No further charges will be made after the
cancellation date, and the Customer retains access to the Service until the end
of the paid period.

**16.2.2.** For yearly subscriptions, cancellation takes effect at the end of
the current annual billing period. No refunds are provided for unused portions
of the yearly subscription, and the Customer retains access to the Service until
the end of the paid period.

**16.2.3.** Cancellation requests must be submitted through the User Account
interface. Cancellation requests sent via email or other methods may not be
processed immediately and do not guarantee cancellation of future charges.

**16.3.** If the Customer wants to delete the entire User Account, the Customer
may do so by contacting dBdone at hello@dbdone.com or pressing the "Delete
Account" button. If the Customer cancels the User Account and still has a valid
paid subscription for the Service, any amount the Customer may already have paid
for the subscription will not be refunded.

**16.4.** The right of either party to terminate the Agreement without notice
for good cause and the right to terminate the Agreement in accordance with
section 17 (extraordinary termination in the event of changes to the GTC) shall
remain unaffected. dBdone shall be deemed to have a good cause to terminate the
contract in particular if (i) the Customer fails to comply with any applicable
legal provisions or (ii) the Customer fails to comply with any terms of these
Terms of Service, in particular section 9.2, and, where reasonable, dBdone has
given the Customer the opportunity to stop any misconduct but the Customer
failed to do so.

**16.5.** With the end of the Agreement, the rights to use the Software pursuant
to clause 7 shall automatically end without any declaration being required from
dBdone. However, the Customer of SaaS Services shall have the right to export
the Customer's data in CSV format within seven (7) days from the end of the
Agreement.

## 17. Changes to the GTC

dBdone reserves the right to change or amend these GTC. The planned changes or
amendments shall be announced to the Customer by e-mail or in writing with a
reasonable period of notice before the planned entry into force. If the Customer
does not object to the amended GTC in text form (e.g. letter or e-mail) within
six (6) weeks after receipt of the e-mail, the amended GTC shall be deemed
accepted, unless such changes affect any primary obligations of dBdone to
provide the Service with the main functions as agreed between the parties. In
the event of an objection or non-acceptance of changes to primary obligations as
stated above, the original GTC shall continue to apply unchanged; in this case,
however, dBdone shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement within the scope of
an extraordinary right of termination with a notice period of thirty (30) days
from receipt of the objection to the end of the current, as applicable, Initial
Term or Renewed Term.

## 18. Links to other Websites

**18.1.** The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that
are not owned or controlled by dBdone.

**18.2.** dBdone has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the
content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.
The Customer further acknowledges and agrees that dBdone shall not be
responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or
alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such
content, goods, or services available on or through any such websites or
services.

**18.3.** dBdone strongly advises the Customer to read the terms and conditions
and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that the Customer
visits.

**18.4.** Third-Party Services Integration

**18.4.1.** dBdone integrates with third-party services including but not
limited to Google, Apple, Stripe, PayPal, and cloud infrastructure providers to
provide its services.

**18.4.2.** When customers use third-party authentication (Google, Apple),
certain profile information may be shared with dBdone in accordance with the
third-party's privacy policy and user consent.

**18.4.3.** Payment processing is handled by third-party providers (Stripe,
PayPal). dBdone does not store credit card information and is not responsible
for the security of payment data handled by third-party processors.

**18.4.4.** dBdone is not liable for any issues, outages, or data breaches that
occur with third-party services, though dBdone will work to minimize service
disruption.

**18.4.5.** Customers acknowledge that their use of third-party services is
subject to the respective third-party terms of service and privacy policies.

## 19. Final Provisions

**19.1.** The European Commission provides a platform for the online settlement
of disputes which can be accessed under http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.
dBdone is neither obliged to take part in alternative dispute resolutions before
a consumer dispute settlement commission nor will do so voluntarily.

**19.2.** The Customer shall only be permitted to offset claims that are
undisputed by dBdone or have been legally established.

**19.3.** The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from and
in connection with this Agreement is Berlin if the Customer is a Business
Customer. The place of performance is the registered office of dBdone.

**19.3.1.** For consumers, disputes may be resolved through the competent courts
at the consumer's place of residence or through alternative dispute resolution
mechanisms.

**19.3.2.** Before initiating formal legal proceedings, both parties agree to
attempt to resolve disputes through good faith negotiations for a period of 30
days.

**19.3.3.** dBdone participates in the EU's Online Dispute Resolution platform
for consumer disputes, accessible at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.

**19.4.** The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply exclusively. If
the Customer is a Consumer and has his/her habitual residence in another
country, the Customer shall, however, continue to have the protection afforded
to consumers by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue
of the law applicable in the state of the Customer's habitual residence.

**19.5.** Should a provision of these GTC be or become invalid, contain an
inadmissible deadline provision or a loophole, the legal validity of the
remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. Insofar as the invalidity does not
result from a violation of §§ 305 ff. BGB (validity of general terms and
conditions), an effective provision which comes closest to the economic
intentions of the parties shall be deemed to have been agreed in place of the
ineffective provision. The same shall apply in the event of a loophole. In the
event of an invalid term, the legally permissible term shall apply.
