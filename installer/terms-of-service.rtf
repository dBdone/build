In the event of an objection or non-acceptance of changes to primary obligations as stated above, the original GTC shall continue to apply unchanged; in this case, however, dBdone shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement within the scope of an extraordinary right of termination with a notice period of thirty (30) days from receipt of the objection to the end of the current, as applicable, Initial Term or Renewed Term.\par}

.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b 18.4.} The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply exclusively. If the Customer is a Consumer and has his/her habitual residence in another country, the Customer shall, however, continue to have the protection afforded to consumers by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the law applicable in the state of the Customer\u8217's habitual residence.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b 18.5.} Should a provision of these GTC be or become invalid, contain an inadmissible deadline provision or a loophole, the legal validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. Insofar as the invalidity does not result from a violation of \u167 ?\u167 ? 305 ff. BGB (validity of general terms and conditions), an effective provision which comes closest to the economic intentions of the parties shall be deemed to have been agreed in place of the ineffective provision. The same shall apply in the event of a loophole. In the event of an invalid term, the legally permissible term shall apply.\par}
